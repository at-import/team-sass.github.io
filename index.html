      <section class="about"><h1>Go Team Sass</h1>
<p>One of the hardest things in the Sass and front end communities in general is being able to find and share work with each other. As such, lots of really great work tends to get duplicated project after project instead of everyone coming together to work towards common goals. We can have all of the install and search features under the sun, but a name neither guarentees us the project we want nor encourages us to collaborate together. We aim to fix that.</p>
<p>Team Sass is a collective of likeminded front end designers and developers coming together to build awesome, high quality, open source Sass projects. It is also a collection of projects made by said designers and developers, all screened to ensure a minimum level of code quality, broad usefullness, and general all-around awesomeness. All of the projects also share a similar ethos of flexibility and end-user control and are designed to be tools to use as opposed to packages to be applied.</p>
